To prevent incomplete code in the future, I plan on starting my assignment earlier in the week. Even though getting sick is out of my control, if I had started my assignment earlier, maybe I could've completed it before I got sick. If this were my job, I would tell my boss \"hey, I'm sick sorry\" except in a more professional way. If I am submitting incomplete code more than once, that would be an issues, so I'm going to make sure this was a one time incident. Although my code is half baked, there are some similarities between my code and the technical notes. I followed the pseuod-code closely, so my find_reachable_from method includes a while loop and if statement and a for loop and if statement. However, the line of crucial line of code that I did not include is if G[u][v] != G[0][0]:. I also used sets instead of arrays which was not the smartest decision. My count_components method is also similar to the techinal notes except I added an unecessary for loop when I could have just used .extend. I also included comments and test code. Overall, my main takeaway from this assignment is to manage my time more wisely to avoid incomplete code.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NUYXuHvZMu8Y"}}]}
