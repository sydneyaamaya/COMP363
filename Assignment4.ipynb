I found it easy to test the three posssibilities using three if statements. Comparing my code to the solution code, they are very similar. Something the solution code includes that I didn't include is the parameter gap_symbol. I chose to use a string instead of a parameter, but going forward maybe it would make my code more sophisticated if I used variables as opposed to creating a string in each iteration. The only other difference between my code and the solution code is how I chose to name things. While naming conventions are important, I think the difference is negligible. The logic of my code follows the logic of the solution code exactly. Both use a while loop that ends when either i or j is no longer greater than 0. Both test the three possible paths -- diagnoal, up and left -- using if statements. I also included comments in my code to explain my thought processes. I also tested my code, and my test returned the correct solution. Overall, I believe I did good work with this assignment."],"metadata":{"id":"1ASRLWSLMQ3d"}}]}
