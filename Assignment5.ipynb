Like the technical notes, my code includes the if statement S[i][r] == S[i-1][r - w[i - 1]] + v[i - 1] that if true the ith item should be added. If false, then the ith item is not added. Something I should not have included in retrospect was my else statement that subtracts one from i. This statement is unecessary because I could just have i = i -1 oustide of the if statement so it always executes no matter if the if statement executes. I think I was trying to make sure both scenarios (add ith item or don't add ith item) were tested that I overlooked the fact that I did not need to include the unnecessary statement. I also noticed two key differences between my code and the technical notes. First, I used a while loop instead of a for loop. Second, my parameters included c_max which I used to initialize r. I see in the technical notes that r = len(S[0])-1. I think this is another example of unnecessary code I've added. In the future, I should make sure the code I'm writing  is as concise as it can be. In my code I also included a guard statement and comments. My code also results in the solultion[5,4,1,0] altough my code reverses it so it's in order making it [0,1,4,5]."],"metadata":{"id":"SV6TRl5JbP95"}}]}
