Comparing my code to the technical notes, I see that they are very similar. Like the technical notes, my kruskal method uses two for loops to traverse G, adds the edge and weight to E, sorts the edges in non decreasing order using merge sort, and then traverses the edges of T to see if each edge is in a different component adding the edge to T if it is in a different component. One difference between my code and the technical notes is that I created merge and mergsort methods to sort my edges outside of my kruskal method. I did this because I'm used to seperating my sorting methods in Java, but now I know I can have a method within a method in python. The other difference between my code and the technical notes is that I used a for loop instead of a while loop to check if each edge was already in the component. The pseudo-code did say to use a while loop, so in retrospect I should've used a while loop. I used a for loop because I had a lot of trouble debugging my code, and I opted to use a for loop so that I would know every edge was visited since my bug was related to how my code was adding edges to components. Besides these two differences, my code outputs the same output as the technical notes, so I know my code works. I also included significant comments to my code to explain what I was coding. Going to office hours also helped me a lot, and I'm glad I used my resources."],"metadata":{"id":"vW2vEAa9sukl"}}]}
