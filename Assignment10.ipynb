A good chouce I made was to test my code, and even though my results were not 100% accurate, my testing showed me that my thought process was on the right track. I also included comments to explain my thought processes. I did change heapify_up to reflect a min heap, but I should've made more changes to heapify down to reflect a min heap. I also should've made a seperate class for the min_heap instead of create a min heap using the max heap method. While my attempt to utilize a min heap in huffman is a little messy and could be better, it was an honest attempt. Like the techinical notes, I initialize a min heap in get_huffman_roots. I made a mistake in get_smallest_root since I thought using pop() on the min heap would be sufficient, but now I realize it wasn't needed. This leads to another issue in my huffman message where I call get_huffman_roots when I could just use pop(). It functions the same, but it is inefficient. My encode method is the same as the technical notes. Even though my code could be more sophisticated, it was an honest attempt I'm proud of."],"metadata":{"id":"R6hSxpeB_FwE"}}]}
