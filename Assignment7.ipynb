My efficient method follows the same logic as the efficient method from the technical notes. In fact, my efficient method is almost the exact same as the techincal notes except I made one fatal mistake which is I switched u and v in the for loops. I wrote for u in topEdges instead of for v in topo which does not traverse the vertices in the top sort and finds each edge it does the opposite. My in degree and out degree methods are in much better shape than my efficient method. The main difference between my in and out methods is that for my in degree method I wrote\n","  for v in range(n):\n","      for u in range(n):\n","      inDegrees[v] += 1\n","which functions the same as the for loops in the technical notes' in degree method. I also included guard statements in my in degree and out degree methods to catch if there is not more than one vertex if len(G) < 2 : return null. In retrospect, I made my code more complicated then it needed to be. My thought process was that in degrees and out degrees are opposites so I should swap v and u, but I see now there was no need for me to do that. My top method's logic also follows the logic of the top method in the tehcnical notes except once again I forgot one key line of code which is if G[u][v] != G[0][0]:. I don't know why I made these two mistakes in two of my methods, but going forward I need to review my code better. In my opinion, I've been consistent with the quality and quantity of my comments. Looking at the comments in the technical notes, my code's comments look similar in quantity and content. Although my code does get most of the answers right, it is off by one printing ([0, 7, 6, 2, 20, 9], [None, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1]) instead of ([0, 7, 6, 2, 15, 9], [None, 3, 3, 0, 5, 1]).

My attendence has been great, I have not missed one class so far. Although I have raised my hand to answer questions, I can participate more in class by asking more questions and also answering questions more. I should also participate more out of class by attending office hours or emailing my questions. For the first few assignments, I felt like I did not need to attend office hours or reach out via email. However, seeing how my last two assignments went, I think I need to utilize office hours more. The quality of my assignments has been consistent. I have tested my code for every assignment, and I have included comments in all of my code for each assignment. I also think my reflections have explained what my code does well and what I need to improve on. I haven't thought about writing my reflections as cover lettters before, so going forward I will keep this in mind. I think right now I deserve a B as my final grade."],"metadata":{"id":"ViF9lLOjul18"}}]}
