One thing I did do is include some guard statements. The most obvious mistake I made was using two pointers. I will say I did not use AI to generate my code. I like using the website GeeksforGeeks to look at code references, and in their example they used two pointers. I remembered in COMP 271 using two pointers where one is fast and one is slow will result in the slow pointer ending in the middle. I thought using two pointers was sophisticated, so I let my ego get the best of me. It would have been much more efficient and simpler to use the self.size field. Going forward, I should think more critically before I code about how I can accomplish something with less lines of code. I like to write out my pseudo code on paper before I code, so I made sure to add comments that explain my thinking when I was writing my pseudo-code. I think my comments do a good job explaining what my code does, but maybe I can add more in future assignments. I did make sure to test my code, and it does work which makes me happy. I utilized the Node Class, but I should have used the Linked_List class more. Even though my code is successful, there are many mistakes I need to improve on. If this were my job, my boss would say  code that runs is the bare minimum and I should think more critically about how I implement my algorithms."],"metadata":{"id":"8Oj4OtK73wMb"}}]}
