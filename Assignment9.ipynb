Starting with my get_huffman_codes method, I struggled with the recusion, but eventually I was able to find a way to get my method to work how I wanted it to. The main difference between my method and the technical notes are the parameters. My method's parameters are root, path=\"\", codes = None, left = \"0\", right = \"1\" while the technical notes parameters are node, path, table. Although my code works, the technical notes accomplish the same task in a more concise way. My main takeaway from this method is that I need to make sure the variable I am updating through recursion does not get reset in every call. My encode method is also similar to the technical notes besides the parameters -- mine uses message, code and the notes use message. My report_efficiency_compression method takes the same parameters (encoded and raw message) as the notes, but the notes do what my method does in less lines. I think my takeaway here is to try to find where I can make my code more concise. Since I'm strill relatively new to Python, sometimes writing out unnecessary lines of code helps me comprehend what Python is doing better. Lastly, my decode method functions the same as the decode method in the technical notes, except the notes' method take mroe parameters which means the variables do not have to written again in the if statements. Overall, my code works, my code looks organized, I added comments, and testing. However, I could've made better use of the Node object."],"metadata":{"id":"QmwRhRfH_KIO"}}]}
